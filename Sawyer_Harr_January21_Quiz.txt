What does a semicolon do?
It basically brings a statement to an end.
int x = 5;

It goes further into a subset of instructions.
Debug.Log (“Hello Professor”);

What is syntax? Give two examples.
Syntax is the order and manner in which script must exist to function correctly.
For example, Debug Log (“Fail”); won’t work because you are missing a period. As a result
the program doesn’t know what to do with it.
Another example is Debug.Log (“Fail Again”)
You are missing a semicolon, so there is no dice there.

or
Debug.Log (“Direct String”);
